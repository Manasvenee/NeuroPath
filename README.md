# NeuroPath

### Overview

NeuroPath is a therapeutic game designed to aid stroke patients in regaining and improving their sensory and motor skills. This project was developed with the understanding that engaging, repetitive tasks can stimulate neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. The game incorporates elements of visual, cognitive, and motor skill exercises, presented in an accessible and encouraging format.

### Target Audience

This game is specifically intended for stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation, under the guidance of occupational therapists or other healthcare professionals. Its adaptive difficulty and simple interface make it suitable for individuals with varying levels of impairment.

### Game Components

NeuroPath consists of three primary game modes, each targeting different aspects of sensory and motor rehabilitation:

1.  **Word Wizardry:** A typing game where patients must accurately type displayed quotes. This exercise is designed to improve cognitive processing speed, accuracy, and fine motor skills. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the patient improves, providing a continuous challenge.

2.  **Shape Builder:** A tracing game where patients trace outlined shapes on the screen. This activity helps in enhancing hand-eye coordination, motor control, and spatial awareness. The game provides visual feedback on tracing accuracy and tracks progress over time.

3.  **Shape Shifter:** A drag-and-drop game where patients match different shapes (triangle, circle, square) to their corresponding targets. This game aims to improve pattern recognition, problem-solving skills, and fine motor dexterity. The increasing speed of moving targets challenges the patient's focus and reaction time.

### Technical Implementation

*   **Language:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
*   **Libraries/Frameworks:** None (purely implemented using web technologies)
*   **Accessibility:** The game is designed with accessibility in mind, featuring clear visual cues, adjustable font sizes, and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Data Storage:** Progress and performance data can be stored locally using browser storage or integrated with a remote database for tracking patient improvement over time.
*   **UI Design:** The user interface (UI) is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and uncluttered layout.

### Development Approach

1.  **Design:** Created a detailed system design document outlining the game's architecture, UI design, and data management strategy.
2.  **Implementation:** Employed agile development methodologies, with iterative development cycles and frequent testing to ensure quality and responsiveness to feedback.

### Future Enhancements

*   **Adaptive Difficulty:** Implement more sophisticated algorithms to dynamically adjust the game's difficulty based on the patient's real-time performance.
*   **Multiplayer Mode:** Add a multiplayer mode to enable patients to play and compete with each other, fostering social interaction and motivation.
*   **Integration with Wearable Sensors:** Integrate the game with wearable sensors to capture and analyze the patient's movements and provide more personalized feedback.
*   **Customizable Exercises:** Allow therapists to create and customize exercises tailored to the specific needs of individual patients.
